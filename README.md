# Raspberry Pi
---
Weekend Raspberry Pi projects. Each project folder contains a breadboard picture (fritzing), python code and a short video. Below is the list:

1. Blink: A Simple GPIO code to get started with. LED blinks when the code is run in the terminal: `$python3 blink.py` 

2. PushButton: A LED will blink when a push button is NOT pressed. However, the LED stay on continually when the push button IS pressed. Demo available at [Youtube](https://youtu.be/P6J-T9LiKJA)

3. Socket: Making a listen server to a port (55555). Use [NetCat](http://netcat.sourceforge.net/) to make request in another terminal.

4. PulseWidhModulation: to control actuators (in this case a servo) using Pulse Width Modulation (PDM).Thus, look at the pins of Raspberry Pi and identify PWM pins before using. I am using pin number 32 (BOARD numbering). The demo is available at [Youtube](https://youtu.be/Vz7-1uDE2Uw).
